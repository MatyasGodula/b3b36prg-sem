hwo to handle keyboard

how to communicate between threads
    event queue
    main thread reads event queue
    other threads will push events to the queue

how to visualize

    xwin_sdl

how to set up / configure parameters
    by default use simpler values

architecture
    --main-- 
        create threads
    events:
        * pipe_in - read messages from the computational module
        * keyboard -- 
        * main_logic -- 

        * resources 
        * keyboard (read) / stdin and a graphical window
        * pipe (in read)
        * pipe (out write)

        threads:
        * boss - main() - create and join all other threads
        * keyboard (read keyboard) -  read nad send events to main()
        | - read keyboard -- translate keybindings to events (to call actions via main)
        | - push events to queue

        * pipe_in (computational_module.out) send events to main()
        | - read pipe
        | - push events to queue
        
        * main (read events from other threads, pipe write computational_module.in, graphics window)
        | - pop events from queue
        | - write pipe
        | - refresh xwin
